### About

Canyon map is an application that attempts to display known canyoneering routes, worldwide. Canyon data is obtained from a variety of sources including official guides, trip reports, and other maps. Please note that some existing canyons with recorded descents may or may not be included because of the time commitment required in updating the map. Periodic updates will add additional routes and future versions of the app will potentially include added functionality.

The information provided by this map should not be used for navigational purposes. Before attempting to descend a canyon make sure that you have the proper training/experience and the necessary permits and knowledge to do so safely.*
